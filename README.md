# School Assignment: ReactJS Portfolio Frontend Application


> "Your task is to create a portfolio frontend application utilizing ReactJS and the Bootstrap CSS framework. This assignment will demonstrate your ability to set up a React project, implement component-based architecture, and use Bootstrap for layout and styling."


## The App contains
- Four functional components
- Bootstrap cards
- Conditional rendering (as extra)
- Own styling (css and bootstrap)
- A couple of media queries to ensure responsiveness
- Passed checks by Wave (Web Accessibility Evaluation Tools)

## My comments
The main idea was to generate a simple responsive portfolio page with ReactJS and Bootstrap. I focused on the responsiveness and calm layout. The content was not the priority in this assignment.
